# TypeScript Mastery

Learn TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that makes building large-scale applications a breeze!

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript is a programming language that extends JavaScript by adding types which allows you to keep the syntax of the popular JavaScript language while creating programs that are less error-prone. TypeScript helps you save time catching errors and providing fixes before you run code.

It also makes JavaScript easier to understand by laying out exact specifications for what data your program expects and what it’ll output. Adopting TypeScript does not have to be a binary choice; TypeScript allows you to determine how strict it should be when enforcing these types. By using TypeScript, you’re gaining a lot of functionality that isn’t offered by JavaScript alone.

## Learning Outcomes 

You will learn how to apply TypeScript’s type system usin JavaScript syntax that you already know. This applies to storing values of specific data types in variables, checking the types of function arguments, making sure that elements in arrays are all consistent types, and more!
