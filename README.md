# TypeScript Mastery

Learn TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that make building large applications a breeze!

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript is a programming language that extends JavaScript by adding types which allows you to keep the syntax of the popular JavaScript language while creating programs that are less error-prone. TypeScript helps you save time catching errors and providing fixes before you run code.

It also makes JavaScript easier to understand by laying out exact specifications for what data your program expects and what it’ll output. Adopting TypeScript is not a binary choice; TypeScript allows you to determine how strict it should be when enforcing these types. By using TypeScript, you’re gaining a lot of functionality that isn’t offered by JavaScript alone.

## Learning Outcomes 

You will learn how to use the JavaScript syntax that you already know and apply TypeScript’s type system. This applies to storing values of specific data types in variables, checking the types of function arguments, making sure that elements in arrays are all consistent types, and more!
