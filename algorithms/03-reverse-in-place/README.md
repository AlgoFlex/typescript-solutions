### Algorithm #3: Reverse Array In Place

---

Write a function that reverses an array of strings or numbers.

**Hints**

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

**Examples**

Example 1:

Input: arr = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

Example 2:

Input: arr = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

Example 3:

Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

**Constraints**

    1 <= s.length <= 105
    s[i] is a printable ascii character.
